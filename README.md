# Python Practice Repository

This repository contains beginner-to-intermediate level Python programs and mini-projects created as part of my ongoing practice and learning journey. The goal is to improve my understanding of Python fundamentals by systematically building topic-wise solutions, small projects, and well-commented code.

## Contents

Each file demonstrates a specific Python concept or combines multiple ideas into mini-projects. New programs will be added as I learn more topics and deepen my Python skills.

### Completed Topics (with program files):
- **Modules, Comments, pip** (`modules_demo.py`)
- **Variables and Datatype** (`var_types.py`)
- **Strings** (`string_tools.py`)
- **Lists and Tuples** (`list_stats.py`, `tuple_ops.py`)
- **Student Name Management Project** (`student_manager.py`)

## How to Use

- Browse the `.py` files as reference examples for basic to intermediate Python coding.
- Each script is self-contained and includes comments explaining the logic.
- Useful for self-study, revision, or as sample practice problems for learners.

## Whatâ€™s Next

Topics and projects will be uploaded as I progress:
- Conditional statements, loops, functions, file I/O
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- And more advanced material as I continue learning!
